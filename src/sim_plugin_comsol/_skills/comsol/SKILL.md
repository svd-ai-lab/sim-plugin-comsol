description: Use when working with COMSOL Multiphysics through the sim runtime, shared-desktop client-server GUI collaboration, a fallback Desktop attach workflow, or saved `.mph` artifacts — building/debugging/solving stateful COMSOL models through the JPype Java API when structured runtime inspection is needed, controlling an already-open ordinary Desktop through Java Shell for small human-in-the-loop edits, and performing offline `.mph` introspection without a JVM.

# comsol-sim

This file is the **COMSOL Multiphysics** index. Use the sim runtime/JPype path
for serious model building, solving, inspection, saved `.mph` artifacts, and
reliable live GUI collaboration through `visual_mode=shared-desktop`. Use
Desktop attach as a fallback for small user-visible edits in an already-open
ordinary COMSOL Desktop, quick visual checks, or human-in-the-loop
interventions. Use the offline `.mph` inspection path for saved artifacts when
no live COMSOL session is needed.

This skill is self-contained for COMSOL work. Do not require a separate skill
checkout or an external sim-cli skill. Use this file for the COMSOL workflow,
and load the plugin-bundled references below only when the task needs them.

## COMSOL-specific layered content

Choose the control path first:

| Path | Use it for | Avoid it for |
|---|---|---|
| sim runtime / JPype | Building, solving, inspecting, debugging, saving `.mph`, repeatable case generation, and reliable live GUI co-editing with `visual_mode=shared-desktop`. | Already-open ordinary Desktop sessions that the user does not want to reconnect as `mphclient`. |
| Desktop attach / Java Shell | Fallback for small visible Desktop edits, quick plots/tables, and user-in-the-loop adjustments in an already-open ordinary COMSOL window. | Long builders, heavy debugging, or anything that needs reliable structured exceptions or server-side inspect. |
| saved `.mph` inspection | Offline summaries, archive diffs, and artifact review without starting COMSOL. | Mutating live model state. |

For the sim runtime, start with `sim check comsol`, then
`sim connect --solver comsol`, then inspect `session.health`. When the user
wants to watch the live Model Builder while the agent builds or solves, use:

```bash
sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
sim inspect session.health
```

Confirm `ui_capabilities.model_builder_live: true`,
`active_model_tag`, and `live_model_binding.ok: true` before treating the GUI
as synchronized with agent edits. For Desktop attach fallback, start with
`sim-comsol-attach open --json --timeout 120` or
`sim-comsol-attach health --json`, then submit bounded Java Shell snippets with
`--submit-key ctrl_enter`. The returned `session.versions` payload tells you
which COMSOL-specific subfolders to load:

```json
"session.versions": {
  "profile":             "mph_1_2_comsol_6_4",
  "active_sdk_layer":    null,        // single SDK line (mph 1.x), no overlay
  "active_solver_layer": "6.4"        // or "6.2" / "6.1" / "6.0"
}
```

There is no `sdk/` overlay because all supported COMSOL versions pin a
single `mph` line (1.2.x). Always read `base/`, then your active
`solver/<slug>/`.

### `base/` — always relevant

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `base/workflows/block_with_hole/` | Steady-state thermal of a heated block with a cylindrical hole. 6 numbered Python steps (`00_create_geometry.py` … `05_plot_temperature.py`). The smallest plugin-owned smoke/reference workflow for this driver. |
| `base/workflows/model_review_loop.md` | Required checkpoint loop for geometry, materials, physics, mesh, study, and results. Use this before continuing after each meaningful edit. |
| `base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md` | Failure triage loop for a failed `sim exec`: inspect `last.result`, inspect live model state, inspect suspicious node properties, then retry with the smallest patch. |
| `base/reference/runtime_introspection.md` | Live-session inspection contract: preferred `sim inspect` targets, compatibility rules, partial results, and raw Java fallbacks. |
| `base/reference/java_api_patterns.md` | Stable Java API probing patterns: tags first, properties before `set`, selection checks, and version-safe try/except snippets. |
| `base/reference/mph_file_format.md` | `.mph` is a ZIP archive — internal layout, the three `nodeType` variants (compact/solved/preview), the Global Parameter `T="33"` contract, and the stdlib `mph_inspect` reader. Read this when you need to introspect a `.mph` *without* spinning up `comsolmphserver`. |
| `base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md` | Optional pattern for COMSOL-free/Python postprocessing after a solve. Use when the user asks for reusable result artifacts, full-domain VTU field exports, CSV tables, or postprocessing without keeping COMSOL open. |

Larger engineering examples do not live in this plugin skill. Keep this
plugin-owned content focused on the driver protocol, live introspection,
debug loops, and the smallest smoke/reference workflow.

Each numbered step is a self-contained snippet for the sim runtime after
`sim connect --solver comsol`. For Desktop attach, translate only small bounded
steps into Java Shell snippets. Do not assume a Java Shell session always
provides a prebound `model` or `m` variable; probe with a tiny print first, and
prefer the sim runtime when you need a reliable model handle.

Before running a new or complex workflow, read
[`base/reference/runtime_introspection.md`](base/reference/runtime_introspection.md)
and
[`base/workflows/model_review_loop.md`](base/workflows/model_review_loop.md).
For failed snippets, switch immediately to
[`base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md`](base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md)
instead of guessing another full script.

### `solver/<active_solver_layer>/` — release specifics

Empty stubs by default; per-release deltas land here as discovered.

- `solver/6.4/notes.md` — current
- `solver/6.2/notes.md`
- `solver/6.1/notes.md`
- `solver/6.0/notes.md`

### `doc-search/` — local documentation lookup

When a physics feature name, API method, or module capability is unknown,
do **not** guess. Inspect the live model first:

```bash
sim inspect session.health
sim inspect last.result
sim inspect comsol.model.describe_text
sim inspect comsol.node.properties:<tag-or-dot-path>
```

The COMSOL driver may not expose every inspect target on older plugin
builds. If an inspect target is unavailable, use the raw Java fallback
patterns in
[`base/reference/java_api_patterns.md`](base/reference/java_api_patterns.md).
Only after live introspection is insufficient, query the local COMSOL
documentation that ships with every install:

```bash
uv run --project src/sim_plugin_comsol/_skills/comsol/doc-search sim-comsol-doc search "<term>" [--module <substring>]
```

`doc-search` runs in pure CPython: no live COMSOL session, no sim runtime,
and no JVM. It scans the installed COMSOL HTML help on disk.

One-time setup on any host that has COMSOL installed:

```bash
cd src/sim_plugin_comsol/_skills/comsol/doc-search && uv sync
```

(No index build step — each query scans the doc tree in parallel; typical
latency is 1–3 s on a local SSD.)

Tips for good queries:
- Use **2–3 keywords**, not questions. COMSOL search is keyword-matched.
- Filter by `--module battery` / `--heat` / `--cfd` / `--plasma` to bias
  toward a module's plugin folder (matched as a substring of the
  `com.comsol.help.*` name).
- Progressive broadening: if `"C-rate battery"` returns nothing, try
  `"discharge rate"`, then `"battery performance"`.
- For **API / coding** questions, filter `--module programming` or
  `--module api`. Plugin names follow `com.comsol.help.*` — inspect a
  few results and adjust.

To read the full text of a hit:

```bash
uv run sim-comsol-doc retrieve com.comsol.help.battery/battery_aging.03.01.html
```

See `doc-search/README.md` for discovery details and the install-root
override (`--comsol-root`) if auto-detection fails.

#### Application Gallery: local vs. web

The local index also covers the **Application Gallery** content for every
module the user has installed — those plugins are named
`com.comsol.help.models.*` (e.g. `com.comsol.help.models.battery.li_battery_1d`).
Filter with `--module models` to scope a search to example-model docs:

```bash
uv run sim-comsol-doc search "thermal runaway" --module models.battery
```

For models that belong to **modules not installed** on the user's host
(or for browsing by image/category), point the user at
<https://www.comsol.com/models>. Don't scrape it from the skill — just
link.

## MPH file introspection (stdlib path — no JVM)

For "what's in this `.mph`?" queries — parameters, physics tags,
nodeType, mesh/solution sizes — prefer the stdlib reader over a live
JVM:

```python
from sim_plugin_comsol.lib import inspect_mph
summary = inspect_mph(path)   # one-shot dict
```

`MphArchive` (context manager) and `mph_diff` (two-file delta) are
also available. `MphFileProbe` is wired into the driver's default
probe list, so any `.mph` produced by a `sim` run is auto-described
in `sim inspect last.result` — no extra call needed.

See [`base/reference/mph_file_format.md`](base/reference/mph_file_format.md)
for the archive layout, the `nodeType` variants, and the Global
Parameter `T="33"` extraction contract.

Use `.mph` archive inspection for saved artifacts and offline comparison.
Use live runtime introspection for the current JPype session, especially
before changing selections, physics features, studies, and result nodes.

## Optional offline postprocessing exports

When the user wants Python-friendly postprocessing without keeping COMSOL
open, export reusable data artifacts once from the live or headless COMSOL
session, then process those files offline. Prefer full-domain VTU field data
and CSV/TXT tables over screenshots or slices as the reusable source data.

See
[`base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md`](base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md)
for the optional bundle layout and headless export snippets.

---

## Headless `comsolbatch` (not yet implemented)

`comsolbatch.exe -inputfile in.mph -outputfile out.mph -batchlog log.txt`
is the canonical non-interactive entry point and would let an agent
run saved models without the long-lived `comsolmphserver` setup. The
driver currently always goes through `comsolmphserver` + JPype. When a
one-shot `comsolbatch` path is available, prefer it for deterministic saved
model batch runs that do not need Desktop collaboration or live introspection.

---

## COMSOL-specific hard constraints

These hard constraints apply to every COMSOL task through this plugin.

1. **Never call `mph.start()` or `client.create()` from a snippet.**
   sim-cli already started a COMSOL JVM and gave you a `model` handle.
   A second `start()` spawns a conflicting JVM.
2. **Image export is broken on Windows.** Use the inspection helpers
   referenced in the workflow READMEs (slice / probe extraction →
   numeric review) instead of `model.result().export()` PNGs. The
   Numeric probes and exported data are more reliable for reviewing results.
3. **Never hardcode COMSOL property names before inspecting the live
   node.** Prefer `sim inspect comsol.node.properties:<target>` or the
   raw Java `properties()` pattern before calling `set(...)`.
4. **Do not run long monolithic model builders.** Build one bounded
   model layer, inspect the live state, then continue.

---

## Model identity, workdir, and checkpoints

For non-trivial COMSOL work, establish a durable model identity and working
folder before building geometry, materials, physics, mesh, or studies.
COMSOL permits untitled `Model1` scratch models, but agents need a clear
artifact to resume from after chat compaction, process restart, server reload,
or human handoff.

Use this policy:

- If the user provided an `.mph`, load that exact file and bind the session to
  a clear model tag derived from the case name.
- If starting from scratch in the sim runtime, pass a descriptive
  `model_tag=<case_slug>` when connecting if the current driver supports it.
- If starting from scratch in shared Desktop or Desktop attach mode, bind to
  the active Desktop model first, then set a visible title/label and save it
  early to an absolute `.mph` path.
- Keep all related files under one working folder, for example:

```text
<workdir>/
  model/<case_slug>.mph
  input/
  output/
  scripts/
  logs/
```

- Set `model.modelPath(...)` to the relevant `input` and `model` folders
  when the workflow uses external files, tables, meshes, or CAD.
- Prefer absolute paths for save/export/log targets. Do not rely on COMSOL's
  launch directory or the Java process current directory.
- After every major layer, save a checkpoint `.mph` or save the main `.mph`
  after confirming the live state. Use names such as
  `<case_slug>_01_geometry.mph`, `<case_slug>_02_materials.mph`, and
  `<case_slug>_03_solved.mph` when intermediate files help review or resume.
- Before resuming a partially completed task, inspect identity first:

```bash
sim inspect session.health
sim inspect comsol.model.identity
sim inspect comsol.model.describe_text
```

Treat `comsol.model.identity.checkpoint_ready=false`, missing
`file_path`/`location`, or a bound tag that does not match `active_model_tag`
as a pause-and-repair condition before doing new modeling work.

Scratch probes and one-off API experiments may stay as `Model1` or
`Untitled.mph`, but label them as disposable in the agent's status and do not
mix them with user-facing engineering artifacts.

---

## Required protocol

Treat COMSOL as a live engineering state, not as a one-shot code generator.
Most user-facing sessions are human-in-the-loop Desktop sessions; keep the
visible model coherent after every step.

COMSOL's Java API is stateful and layered. Many `set(...)` calls mutate the
model tree, but downstream objects and the Desktop view may not reflect those
changes until the relevant sequence is built or run. Use `run()` calls as
intentional synchronization points when the next step depends on updated state
or when the user expects the Model Builder / Graphics view to be current. Do
not make this mechanical: batch coherent edits first, then choose the smallest
appropriate build/run for the layer you changed (for example geometry, mesh,
plot, study, or solver). The goal is to understand and respect COMSOL's
commit/refresh mechanism, not to force a fixed `run()` after every property
assignment.

0. If the question is about a saved `.mph` (parameters, physics tags,
   solved/unsolved state, mesh size), use `inspect_mph(path)` first — no
   JVM and no `sim connect` needed. Skip to step 1 only if the model needs
   to be mutated or solved.
1. Choose the control path. Default to the sim runtime for reliable model
   building, solving, and live GUI collaboration:
   - Use `sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui --driver-option
     visual_mode=shared-desktop` when the user wants real-time Model Builder
     visibility and the agent needs structured `sim inspect`/JPype state.
   - Use the standalone Desktop attach helper only when the user already
     opened ordinary COMSOL Desktop, wants to avoid the `mphclient` server
     login/session switch, or needs a small human-in-the-loop edit.
   - Use plain `sim connect --solver comsol` for no-GUI/server execution,
     driver-managed artifacts, and existing sim runtime workflows.
2. For Desktop attach, run `sim-comsol-attach open --json --timeout 120` or
   `sim-comsol-attach health --json`, then confirm the Java Shell channel is
   ready.
3. For sim runtime, run `sim check comsol`, connect if needed, and read
   `session.versions` plus `sim inspect session.health`.
4. Establish or verify model identity, working folder, and checkpoint target.
   For sim runtime, inspect `comsol.model.identity` when available. For
   Desktop attach, probe the visible model title/file path through Java Shell
   or the Desktop UI before mutating serious work.
5. Inspect the baseline state. In Desktop attach, use the visible Model
   Builder, Graphics view, tables, and Java Shell output. In sim runtime, use
   `sim inspect comsol.model.describe_text` when available.
6. Execute one bounded modeling step.
7. Inspect the result before continuing: visible Desktop state for attach;
   `sim inspect last.result`, `comsol.model.describe_text`, and
   `comsol.node.properties:<tag-or-dot-path>` for sim runtime.
8. Save or update the relevant checkpoint after each passed major layer.
9. Continue only after the live model matches the intended geometry,
   materials, physics, mesh, study, and result state and the checkpoint can be
   used to resume.

For simple known-good smoke coverage, use the numbered snippets under
`base/workflows/`. For realistic engineering examples, use project-local
or user-provided recipes and apply the same checkpoint loop.

## GUI and visual inspection modes

COMSOL has several visual surfaces. Do not collapse them into one
"GUI mode" in your reasoning or status reports:

| Mode | What it means | Live with agent edits? |
|---|---|---|
| `no_gui` | `comsolmphserver` API session with no intentional visible windows. This is the canonical sim-cli default. | Yes, API session only. |
| `server-graphics` | `comsolmphserver -graphics`; plot windows may appear when a result plot is run. `ui_mode=gui` is an alias for this. | Yes for the server-side model, but there is no Model Builder tree. |
| `desktop-inspection` | Save a `.mph` artifact, then open it in full COMSOL Desktop / Model Builder. | No. It is an inspection copy unless explicitly reloaded. |
| `shared-desktop` | Full COMSOL Desktop attached to the same server, with the agent binding to the Desktop's active model tag. Request from sim-cli with `--driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop`. | Yes, when `model_builder_live: true`. |
| `desktop-attach` | Fallback ordinary COMSOL Desktop path, controlled through the Java Shell UIA channel via `sim-comsol-attach`. No `mphclient`, no shared server login dialog. | Yes, in the visible Desktop model, but without `sim inspect`/JPype session introspection. |

Use `sim inspect session.health` or `sim exec` target `session.health`
to check `requested_ui_mode`, `effective_ui_mode`, `ui_capabilities`,
PIDs, logs, and visible COMSOL window titles. Treat `model_builder_live:
false` as authoritative: agent-side JPype edits will not automatically
refresh a separately opened COMSOL Desktop window.

### Ordinary Desktop attach helper

For already-open ordinary Desktop sessions, the standalone helper is the
fallback path. Agents and humans must use the same command path:
prefer `uvx --from sim-plugin-comsol sim-comsol-attach ...` over relying
on a PATH-installed `sim-comsol-attach.exe`. This keeps development,
documentation, and user reproduction aligned even when Python user
Scripts directories are not on PATH.

```powershell
uvx --from sim-plugin-comsol sim-comsol-attach open --json --timeout 120
uvx --from sim-plugin-comsol sim-comsol-attach health --json
uvx --from sim-plugin-comsol sim-comsol-attach exec --file step.java --submit-key ctrl_enter --json
```

When working from a plugin source checkout, use the plugin environment for all
helper scripts and UIA probes:

```powershell
uv run sim-comsol-attach health --json
@'
# small Python helper, screenshot, or pywinauto probe
'@ | uv run python -
```

Do not fall back to bare `python` for Desktop automation; it may use a system
environment that lacks the plugin's UIA and screenshot dependencies.

`open` launches normal `comsol.exe` if no suitable Desktop exists,
clicks Blank Model when needed, opens Java Shell, and waits for a
`SyntaxEditor` input. If `open` reports `desktop_open` but
`shell_not_visible`, use UIA from the plugin environment to select the
Developer ribbon tab, click the `Java Shell` button, then rerun
`sim-comsol-attach health --json`. It does not launch `comsol.exe mphclient`,
so it avoids the repeated "Connect to COMSOL Multiphysics Server" dialog.

For `exec`, submit bounded Java Shell snippets that use COMSOL's Java API
against the visible Desktop model. Keep the same modeling discipline as
`sim exec`: one layer at a time, verify the Desktop after each geometry,
material, physics, mesh, solve, and plot step, then continue. The helper
audits submissions under `.sim/comsol-desktop-attach/audit.jsonl`.

COMSOL 6.4 Desktop gotchas:
- User-opened model windows may be titled `Untitled.mph - COMSOL
  Multiphysics`; target discovery must match titles containing `COMSOL
  Multiphysics`, not only titles starting with it.
- In the docked Java Shell, use `--submit-key ctrl_enter`; click-targeting the
  Run button can paste code without reliably executing it. Before a long model
  step, run a tiny `System.out.println(...)` probe. If it does not appear,
  retry once after reopening or refocusing the Java Shell input. Keep this loop
  simple; `status: "submitted"` means input was submitted, not that COMSOL ran
  the snippet.
- Do not assume Java Shell has a current `model`/`m` variable, or that a model
  created with `ModelUtil.create(...)` is the same model the user sees in the
  Model Builder tree. If the task depends on the exact visible Desktop model,
  confirm the handle first or keep the change small enough for user review. For
  larger builders, switch to the sim runtime and hand off a saved `.mph`.
- Java Shell snippets can be denied writes by COMSOL's Security preference for
  file-system access. Use in-model tables for data handoff, or have the user
  enable file access before saving `.mph` files or exporting CSV/plots.
- For result plots built from table data, the Java feature type is `Table`
  under a `PlotGroup1D`, not `TableGraph`. Use
  `m.result("<pg>").feature().create("<tag>", "Table")`, then set
  `source="table"`, `table="<table_tag>"`, `xaxisdata="<column_index>"`,
  `plotcolumninput="manual"`, and `plotcolumns=new String[]{"<column>"}`.
  `TableFeature.setTableData(double[][])` can populate a small in-model table
  when file export is blocked.
- Do not repurpose a probe plot group for table plots when a clean display is
  required. Probe plot groups can retain probe-specific render state and axis
  cache. Prefer creating a fresh 1D plot group, or reusing an existing native
  table-plot group from the model's results tree.
- For quick user-facing plots such as voltage-capacity curves, an in-model
  table plus a fresh `PlotGroup1D` is a good first visual checkpoint. It can
  validate the Desktop attach, Java Shell execution, table plotting, legend,
  and screenshot loop before investing in a full physics solve.
- When translating tutorial-style model instructions to Java Shell, do not copy
  boundary/domain IDs directly unless there is no better option. Prefer
  parameterized geometry plus named coordinate selections such as `Box`
  selections for terminals, inlets, outlets, symmetry planes, or readout
  regions. Keep coordinate boxes away from corners when selecting edges or
  faces, then print `selection.entities(dim)` before using the selection in
  physics.
- Treat the Graphics pane as stale until the relevant geometry or result node
  is explicitly run. After changing geometry, run the geometry or create a
  result plot that reflects the new component before trusting screenshots.
- For derived quantities such as terminal capacitance, pressure response, or
  reaction-rate integrals, probe candidate expressions with small
  `EvalGlobal`/`EvalPoint` snippets before baking them into a workflow. Solver
  interface variables and terminal feature variable names can vary with physics
  feature settings and tags.
- Avoid setting duplicate plot labels in Java Shell snippets; COMSOL throws a
  duplicate-label exception before later plot setup lines run. Either remove the
  old plot group first or leave the existing label unchanged.

By default, `exec` rejects arbitrary Java lines that do not start from the
COMSOL model surface. Use `--allow-arbitrary-java` only for deliberate
diagnostic snippets. If you need structured model introspection, saved
artifacts, or cross-session runtime state, switch back to the driver path
with `sim connect --solver comsol`.

Shared-desktop gotcha for COMSOL 6.4: launching
`comsol.exe mphclient -host localhost -port <port>` does attach a full
Desktop to `comsolmphserver`. However, if JPype creates a separate
server model tag with `ModelUtil.create("SharedProbe")`, the Desktop
does not automatically switch from its active `Model1` tree to that
new tag. When JPype instead mutates `ModelUtil.model("Model1")`, the
Desktop refreshes: the title, Model Builder tree, and Graphics view
show the API-created component/geometry. The implemented
`shared-desktop` mode therefore discovers or negotiates the active
Desktop model tag and routes agent edits to that tag.

Use:

```powershell
sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
```

Then verify `session.health`: `effective_ui_mode` should be
`shared-desktop`, `ui_capabilities.model_builder_live` should be `true`,
and `active_model_tag` should name the model that agent snippets will
mutate.

### Attach-only external server

If repeated API client disconnects occur, or a user wants one COMSOL
server to survive multiple sim sessions, use an externally managed server
instead of mixing sim and ad hoc JPype scripts. The user or agent starts
`comsolmphserver` first in an interactive Windows shell:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\COMSOL\COMSOL64\Multiphysics\bin\win64\comsolmphserver.exe" -port 2036 -multi on -login auto -silent
```

Then connect through sim with explicit attach-only ownership:

```powershell
sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui `
  --driver-option attach_only=true `
  --driver-option port=2036 `
  --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
```

In attach-only mode, `session.health` should show
`server_owner: "external"` and `attach_only: true`. `sim disconnect`
disconnects the JPype client and any plugin-launched Desktop client, but
does not kill the external `comsolmphserver`. Keep all agent operations
inside the sim session; use ad hoc JPype only as a diagnostic escape hatch.

### Screenshot responsibility

On a Codex Desktop host with access to the interactive solver GUI, prefer Codex's own desktop
screenshot/view tools for visual review. They see the same
interactive desktop the user sees and avoid adding solver-specific
screenshot commands to sim-cli. Use `sim screenshot` only when the
solver GUI is on a remote host that Codex cannot directly capture.

When you perform GUI-visible work, review the Desktop state after every significant action:

1. Launch or connect.
2. Geometry build or import.
3. Material assignment.
4. Physics setup.
5. Mesh build.
6. Solve and result plot.
7. Save/open `.mph` for Desktop inspection when Model Builder review is needed.

### COMSOL-specific dialogs

- **"连接到 COMSOL Multiphysics Server"** / **"Connect to COMSOL
  Multiphysics Server"** may be a stale or separate Desktop/client
  login dialog. It does not prove the JPype server session failed.
  Verify by checking `session.health`, the port, PIDs, and visible
  window titles.
- **"是否保存更改?"** / **"Save changes?"** appears on Desktop close if
  a separately opened `.mph` has unsaved edits. Choose Save or Don't Save
  according to the user's intent.

Prefer the JPype path (`model.*`, `ModelUtil.*`) for programmable model
construction and solving. Use Desktop inspection only when a human needs
to see the Model Builder tree or interact with file/dialog surfaces.
