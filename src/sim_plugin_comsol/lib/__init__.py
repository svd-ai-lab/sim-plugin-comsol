"""Cross-platform COMSOL helpers — pure-Python utilities that walk a live
COMSOL Java model tree to produce human-readable summaries.

Like `flotherm/lib/`, this subpackage holds code that can be exercised
on macOS / Linux without COMSOL installed (the live-tree code paths are
mocked in unit tests). The boundary mirrors the deferred-package
convention: when this grows past ~1500 LOC or a second consumer wants
the API, it migrates to `sim-comsol` on PyPI.
